# Cats vs Dogs Neural Network

## Overview
This project is aimed at building a neural network model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of cats and dogs, and it learns to distinguish between the two classes.

## Dataset
https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cats_vs_dogs

The dataset used for training and testing the neural network consists of ~25 thousands of images of cats and dogs. The images are labeled accordingly to indicate whether they contain a cat or a dog. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets to train, validate, and evaluate the model's performance.
