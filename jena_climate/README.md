# Jena Climate Dataset 2009-2016 Prediction Neural Network

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script implementing a neural network for weather predicting based on weather timeseries dataset recorded at the Weather Station of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany. The neural network is trained to predict the weather for a certain number of days based on the data about previous days.

## Dataset
Jena Climate dataset is made up of 14 different quantities (such air temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind direction, and so on) were recorded every 10 minutes, over several years. This dataset covers data from January 1st 2009 to December 31st 2016.
